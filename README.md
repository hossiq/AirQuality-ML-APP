# AirQuality-ML-APP
Exploring the process of leveraging machine learning (ML) to forecast air quality. And step-by-step instructions on integrating this model into a user-friendly application using Flask

**Background**
Polluted Air is responsible for various health issues such as increases the risk of heart disease, respiratory infections, lung cancer, tuberculosis, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, kidney disease and low birth weight, all of which can lead to premature death. And it is a major environmental threat, for instance it contaminate the surface of bodies of water and soil.Meteorology such as Temperature, Wind Speed, Relative Humidity, etc. contribute to air pollution, along with emissions from cars, industries, power plants, crop burning, etc. Air Quality Index (AQI) which is a scorecard of six categories that describe ambient air quality relative to the relevant standards. This project is focused on predicting AQI using meteorological variables.
